# Business Assistant Bot (Node.js) ✍️🚀

###  Overview
This is a professional Telegram Bot prototype developed during my 6th day of learning backend development. The goal was to create a functional lead generation tool for micro-businesses that can capture user requests and notify the administrator instantly.

###  Key Features
* Interactive Menu: Uses inline keyboards for a clean user interface.
* Lead Generation: Captures user messages and phone numbers.
* Admin Notifications: Automatically forwards new customer requests to the admin's private Telegram (Backend logic).
* State Management: Basic logic handling for "Services", "About Us", and "Booking" sections.

###  Tech Stack
* Language: JavaScript (Node.js)
* Framework: Telegraf.js
* Environment: Windows PowerShell / VS Code

###  Learning Progress (Day 6)
This project marks a significant milestone in my 7-year journey toward becoming a Full-stack Developer (Target: 2033). 
Challenges overcome today:
- Environment setup and Windows Execution Policies.
- Handling asynchronous Telegram API requests.
- Managing Node.js processes and debugging 409 Conflict errors.
- Implementing "Catch-all" text handlers for lead generation.

###  How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run npm install to install dependencies.
3. Create a .env file or replace the token in index.js with your own from @BotFather.
4. Run node index.js
